## Overview
"GradesGO" a comprehensive approach for the grade 1 admission mark calculation process in government schools, aiming to streamline operations, reduce paperwork, and enhance transparency. Initially tailored for the Galle district due to the absence of a digitalized solution, our platform seeks to address the island-wide need for a reliable, robust system.To achieve this, we developed a user-friendly website accessible to the public, leveraging latest MERN stack. We prioritized accurate proximity calculations to schools, utilizing Google Maps API for precise distance measurement. Additionally, we compiled a comprehensive digital database specific to the Galle district, containing school coordinates.Our platform generates printable PDF documents reflecting final marks, aligned with government circulars. Each document includes a unique hash for verification via our platform, ensuring accuracy and transparency. Feedback from educators and parents in Galle district, collected through administrative channels, highlights a 98% satisfaction rate, validating our 
platform's success.The feedback mechanism, involving individuals with over 90% computer literacy, proves efficient and cost-effective, empowering parents in their decision-making process. Despite current limitations, our future roadmap includes expanding island-wide and integrating with existing educational systems, fostering greater connectivity and efficiency.


## Introduction

In the realm of education, the transition to Grade 1 marks a significant milestone for both parents and young learners, symbolizing the initiation into formal schooling. However, the current admission process for Grade 1 in government schools is marred by challenges that often result in delays, frustrations, and inefficiencies for all involved. In response to these issues, we present "GradesGo" – an innovative software initiative designed to revolutionize and streamline the Grade 1 school admission process. With a commitment to aligning seamlessly with government guidelines while prioritizing transparency for parents and operational ease for school administrations, GradesGo represents a transformative solution to longstanding administrative hurdles. Traditionally, manual processes have plagued Grade 1 admissions in government schools, leading to complications and delays. GradesGo seeks to usher in a new era by leveraging advanced software technology to automate these procedures GradesGo will serve as a comprehensive and user-friendly tool, offering parents a transparent view of the admission process, from application submission to result declaration.By addressing common challenges faced by parents, GradesGo aims to provide a seamless and efficient experience in securing admission for their children.For school administrators, GradesGo represents a game-changer by automating traditionally cumbersome tasks associated with Grade 1 admissions. This includes application processing, document verification, and merit-based selection – all conducted in accordance with government guidelines. 

## Methodology

- To tackle the identified issue, we devised a user-friendly digital solution tailored to the simplicity preferred by our users. Recognizing the increasing popularity of online services in Sri Lanka, our strategy centered on the development of a web application to achieve our specified goals. 

- Following Agile methodologies, we commenced UI design using Figma, a widely-utilized tool in the industry. Upon approval, we proceeded to build the frontend using React, transitioning handwritten forms into digital formats and digitizing categories for school applications.

- For precise location and distance calculations, we seamlessly integrated the Google Maps JavaScript API. Our system automated marks calculation based on user inputs, facilitating the generation of printable summary reports with verification via our portal.

- In terms of data storage, MongoDB emerged as our choice due to its suitability as a NoSQL database. Given the absence of a centralized school database, we took the initiative to create one specifically tailored to government schools in the Galle district.

- This comprehensive database encompassed crucial details such as school name, latitude, longitude, category, and type. Integration with the frontend was facilitated through a REST API developed with Express, another popular lightweight JavaScript library. 

- Moreover, we ensured robust authentication and authorization handling through the implementation of JWT
